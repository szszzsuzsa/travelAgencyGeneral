                    get easily. The kind of place
                    that isn’t a tourist trap and
                    where you can enjoy the
                    major sites without being

                <p>fter several stopovers and a propeller plane ride, you’ll arrive in a paradise often described as
                    Bali 30 years ago but not yet been discovered by tourist hordes, nor by international hotel chains.

            <h1>Arrival in paradise</h1>
            <p>Siargao is a completely different world to South East Asia’s usual hotspots. The environment, the pace of
                life, and the people create a truly idyllic setting. You’ll find the locals are smiling and kind, and
                they speak good English. Unlike many other tourist destinations, there are no “tourist prices” here. The
                locals are very environmentally conscious as they know the natural environment is their most important
                treasure. Plastic waste and plastic bottles are not common here, straws were banned way before Europe
                has even started the discussions about the idea.
            </p>
            <p>Within moments of arriving, you’ll get in the flow of this way of life, where everyone gets around by
                habal-habal (a type of motorbike with a roof that’s kind of like a tuk-tuk) on the roads and by
                traditional boat between the islands. You’ll even take a boat when zipping between the best beaches and
                surf spots. </p>
            <p>
                One of the highlights of the trip is heading to the local market to buy all kinds of fresh fish,
                seafood, fruit and veg. We’ll then take our haul over to a breathtakingly beautiful island where a local
                family will cook a delicious traditional meal for us that we’ll enjoy on a white sandy beach.

            <h1>Surfing over a
                coral reef</h1>
            <p>he island is surrounded by world class reefs and turquoise water. For those wanting the ultimate Siargao
                experience, it’s worth taking the board out. All beginners get their own personal instructor because
                surfing on reef-breaks can be dangerous for newbies. By the end of the trip, your surfing will improve
                more than you’ve ever imagined, and you’ll definitely form a close bond with your instructor too. For
                experienced surfers, the world-famous Cloud 9 surf spot is at Siargao, and with any luck you’ll be able
                to surf its perfect tubes. </p>
            <p>We planned the itinerary so that those who don’t want to surf also have a magical time. We will visit
                lagoons by boat, climb caves, canoe in a jungle and of course sunbathe on the beach. </p>

            <h1>Head to the party
                in a boat</h1>
            <p>The locals love to party, and there’s always a mix of surfers and locals enjoying themselves at one of
                the island parties. In fact, a party is held on a different venue each night, sometimes even offshore on
                a tiny island, so we’ll head there by boat. Did you know that rum is cheaper than cola on Siargao? Yep,
                that’s right. Ordering a double rum and coke will be cheaper than ordering just a coke. Not to talk
                about triple rum-cokes. Still you’ll want to keep track of your drinks so that you’re ready to head out
                surfing early the next morning!</p>
            <p>After spending 10 days in paradise you will fell in love with Siargao so deeply, that you’ll want to hide
                this amazing destination from others to keep it unspoiled as it is now.</p>
